# Step 3 - Import Custom Data

WooCommerce allows you to import and export products by using CSV files, but unfortunately user roles cannot be imported or exported except extra plugins are used
In this scenario, WebToffee plugin(free version) will be used to demonstrate. Free version plugin only allow users to import and export customer or user role.

## Add new product
There is a Add New Product Page in Products. You can add name of product, description of product, regular price, sale price.

You can do the above automatically by using CSV files.

19 customers in the csv file.
- You can map your custom csv file columes to WordPress MySQL table columes. For example, ID, Customer_ID, User Login etc. 
- The data of your csv file will automatically insert to WordPress wp_users, wp_usermeta table.
- Using plugins to import and export data is recommended. Using MySQL to insert and delete data IN MySQL CLI is not recommended.
- Extra plugins (PHP code) can do the encryption.
